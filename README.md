# Hero of Cherubion

You're a young, promising adventurer who's annoyed at how bad things have gotten in Cherubion, and you're on a mission to restore order. You know that an evil sorcerer is trying to take control of your world, and you know that to confront the tyrant, you must obtain three important items of magic: the Eye of Terror, the Crystal Prism of Chorax and the Pall of Atura. Without these spells you have no chance, but getting them is no easy task...
